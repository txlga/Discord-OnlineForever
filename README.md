## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
### ¬∑ Replit
#### The code inside the repository was originally made to be hostable on [Replit](https://replit.com), but due to a recent ban on all repositories that are against Discord's ToS, you won't be able to import this repository directly to Replit anymore.
#### Here's a workaround to solve that issue:
1. Click [here](https://github.com/txlga/Discord-OnlineForever/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download the latest version of this code.
2. Unzip the file
3. Create a new Python repl on [Replit](https://replit.com)
4. Upload the files into the repl (Just drag and drop it into the files sidebar)
5. Overwrite the files if a prompt pops-up
6. Add your token inside Secrets ([Guide](https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/workspace-features/storing-sensitive-information-environment-variables)) with `TOKEN` as the key and your token as the value
7. Modify both the status mode and custom status, if you want to make any adjustments
8. Run the repl
9. Add your repl url to an uptime monitor

### ¬∑ Docker

This repository includes a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` file. Since pre-built images are not available, you'll need to build them yourself.

### ¬∑ Local Installation
1. Install [Python](https://python.org/downloads) on your machine (Make sure you add it to [PATH](https://i.imgur.com/Ukl6HdQ.png))
2. Copy the code below

if validate.status_code != 200:
  print("[ERROR] Your token might be invalid. Please check it again.")
  sys.exit()

            ],
            "status": status,

        },
    }
    ws.send(json.dumps(cstatus))
    online = {"op": 1, "d": "None"}
    time.sleep(heartbeat / 1000)
    ws.send(json.dumps(online))

def run_onliner():
  print(f"Logged in as {username}#{discriminator} ({userid}).")
  while True:
    onliner(usertoken, status)
    time.sleep(50)

run_onliner()

```
</details>

3. Create a new Python file and paste the code into it
4. Modify both the status mode and custom status, if you want to make any adjustments
5. Save the file
6. Create a `requirements.txt` file and copy and paste the file contents inside [requirements.txt](https://github.com/txlga/Discord-OnlineForever/blob/main/requirements.txt) without the `Flask` module
7. Save the file
8. Open command prompt where both the files are present and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
9. Once the packages are downloaded, either double-click the python file in order to run it or open command prompt where the python file is present and run `python filename.py`

## üîß Known Errors And Fixes
### [Discord] Status is not changing

> Just wait for a few minutes. It takes some time for Discord to refresh your status.

### [Replit] This repository could not be accessed, try again later/This repository possibly violates our Terms of Service. Contact support if you believe this is a mistake.

> As I mentioned before, due to a recent ban on all repositories that are against Discord's ToS, you won't be able to import this repository directly to Replit anymore. Follow <a href="https://github.com/txlga/Discord-OnlineForever?tab=readme-ov-file">this</a> workaround to host the code on Replit.

### [Replit] sh: line 1: python3: command not found

> You cloned it into a bash repl. Make sure you select "Python" from the languages list when you create the repl.

### [Replit] Cloudflare Error/Temporarily banned from accessing Discord's API

> This happens because repls have Shared Public IP Addresses, and some Replit Users abuse the platform to spam (through self bots or nukers). Whenever Discord sees lots of invalid requests coming from a single IP address, it will use Cloudflare to temporarily block any incoming requests.

> Fix:
> - Go to shell
> - Enter <code>kill 1</code>
> - Wait for the repl to reload
> - Run the repl again
